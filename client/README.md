### Project - english description

Made with React JS, Express, Mongo DB, Mongoose.

The project represents an platform for car sharing that allows users to share their rides across the country. 

The user can register, login and logout. The main basic user info is stored in the cookies.

The driver can choose the following fields to create the ride:
- From which city he travels;
- Where he's traveling (city);
- Date of the travel;
- Number of stops that he will make;
- Number of seats in the car for passengers;

The main page consists the all created rides.

Every selected ride consists the following functionality based on the user status:
- The creator of the ride can edit the information of it;
- Logged in users can join a ride or cancel it (if they had taken it before);
- The sighed out users can only see the info of the ride;

Every user has a profile which contains the info of the past trips.




# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
